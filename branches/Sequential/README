README

This project allows the user to define particles, and simulate their collisions.

The particle file needs to be in the form of:
mass position_x position_y velocity_x velocity_y radius

An example of two particles are:
1.0 -5.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.1
1.0 -5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.1

The file test.txt provides an example test of 7 particles colliding.

To run the simulator, please run the SceneTester with the arguments: 
<inputFileName:String> <outputFileName:String> <num_particles:Int> <dt:Double> <duration:Double> <k:Double> <thickness:Double> <COR:Double>

The simulator will create an output file with the output of each particle at each time frame.
You can then run the output with a C++ Simulator_Main.cpp, written using OpenGL, to generate
the simulation.  A Makefile is provided to compile the Simulator_Main.cpp file.  The flags
in the Makefile might need to be changed, depending on what platform the simulator is ran on.  
After compiling the C++ file for the simulator please provide the name of the output file name
as an argument when running the simulator GUI.


Thanks!
