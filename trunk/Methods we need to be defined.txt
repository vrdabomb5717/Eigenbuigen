Methods that must be defined:
	
VectorXs:
	* operator for scalar * VectorXs  and VectVectorXs - DONE
	+ operator - DONE
	- operator - DONE
	/ operator for VectorXs / scalar - DONE
	size():scalar or int - DONE
	norm():scalar
	segment(index:Int):VectorXs (e.g. val x1 = x.segment(2*idx1) )
	+= operator - DONE
	mutator for segment (e.g. gradE.segment(2*idx2) += force.segment(2);)

Scalar:
	+ operator
	* operator
	- operator

MatrixXs:
	transpose()
	* operator for MatrixXs and VectorXs - DONE
	<< operator to append to matrix (e.g. deltaN << -1, 0, 1, 0, - DONE
			   										 0, -1, 0, 1;) to append a list or array to a matrix's rows and columns
	constructor(rows, columns)
	getRows()
	getColumns()
